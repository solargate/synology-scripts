# Synology Scripts

Useful scripts for Synology NAS that I created for personal use.

`video-thumbs-gen.sh` - Generates video thumbnails for Synology Media Server (using ffmpeg). Thumbnails are generated for all media files starting from the root directory and all subdirectories.

`video-thumbs-del.sh` - Deletes video thumbnails starting from the root directory and all subdirectories.
